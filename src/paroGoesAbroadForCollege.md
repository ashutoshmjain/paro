It was like a ceremoney at Paro's home. No one from the town had ever flown to US for undergrad. No one even went for higher ed. Parents of some of he kids go to Asia Pac or sometimes to EU but none been so far to the Americas. Paro was not excited. She didn't want to leave Dev but her mother had a notion that she is falling for Dev that was not okay to her. Paro's dad was a non actor but he had friends in US who would host Paro till she gets settled at her new school. In fact one of them was currently visiting India who will join Paro at Delhi Airport. Paro's brother was to company her to Delhi. He hated Dev.
