Paro woke up with sudden noise from the center of the home. It seemed Balram Kaka was shouting . The house - also called Badi Haveli was built in a fashion - that any one even talking in the center ground could be heard. The center yard , also called Aahata was ioopen to the sky. A covered corridor led tp the center court from the main door that had large wooden gates tempered with iron brackets. All four sides , had three stories built over a period of time - almost hundred years. The outer walls were almost two and half feet wide , making it a tiny fortress. Paro's room was on the far side of the main entrance. Right outside her room was a big open space on the first floor itself where her husband - the Deewaan of the town used to sit. He could see people sitting in the center court and vice versa. Normally farmers and farm labour would sit in the center court to express their grievances and thanks alike. On both sides, Paro's both sons had their rooms and private seating places facing outside. Second floor was dedicated to the guests. 

Paro wasn't fully awake yet but she could hear Balram Kaka - commonly called Ballam Da , very clearly. She couldn't get the context but she heard loud and clear - "Someone had died under the Banyan tree " . The tree was just across the street from the main gate. It was kinda the extent of Paro's outside trip on daily basis. She used to render water from her evening prayers to the setting sun every evening. One could see the setting Sun from the peripharial circular chabootra around the tree . Many farm workers who showed up to get their wages around noon used to rest here after the sumptuous lunch that every one got from Paro's kitchen. 

A strange feeling took over Paro. She wanted to ask "who died ?" But seemed like she knew. He had said he will come around at least once before he died. Words got trapped in her mouth. She lie there lifeless in her bed as if forgot to breathe. And then two tears rolled off her eyes down to hew cheeks. More gathered around her ears.

She could hear her husband rushing down. Her elder son used to go out early for hunting. He was obviously not home but his wife ran down. The younger son was a late riser. His wife was trying to wake him up - "Your dad is calling you . Wake up its an emergency". Paro's eyes were stuck on the ceiling. A ceiling she had spent many nights gazing in the early days of her marriage.
